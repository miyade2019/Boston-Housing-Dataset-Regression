# 🏠 Boston Housing Dataset Regression
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting house prices in the Boston area using regression techniques. The project leverages various machine learning models to understand the factors affecting housing prices and build an accurate predictive model.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Boston Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset often used to practice regression techniques in machine learning. This project involves analyzing the dataset, applying feature engineering, and building regression models to predict house prices.

## ✨ Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough analysis to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering: Improved model performance through feature selection and transformation.
Regression Models: Compared multiple models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regressor.
## 📁 Dataset
Features: The dataset includes information about housing such as crime rate, average number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more.
Target: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s).
## 📈 Approach
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and performed data normalization to ensure all features are on a comparable scale.
Created new features based on domain knowledge to capture more information about the dataset.
Model Building:
Implemented and tuned several regression models to find the one that best predicts the house prices.
Used cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score to determine the best performing model.
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python: The main programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing regression models and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data relationships and model performance.
## 🎯 Results
The Random Forest Regressor achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicating it was the best model for predicting house prices.
Feature Importance: Identified the most influential features, such as the number of rooms and proximity to employment centers.
📊 Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap: Showed relationships between features.
Feature Importance Plot: Illustrated the significance of different features in predicting house prices.
